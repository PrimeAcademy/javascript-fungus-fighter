# jQuery Fungus Fighter

Fight mutant fungus villains, with jQuery!

![demo](demo.gif)

It is you versus the Freaky Fungus, an evil mycological menace from mars. Use your jQuery skills to dispatch attacks against your enemy. To win, the Freaky Fungus must have 0 hit points (HP) before you are out of attack points (AP).



## Requirements

- When you click an attack button, update _state_ to make the Freaky Fungus lose hit points (HP), and to reduce your attack points (AP). 
  - State may be held in one our more variables of your choosing
  - See [Attacks](#attacks) below, for AP and HP values
  - HP and AP should never fall below zero
- Render state changes to the DOM:
  - Update the value of each `<progress>` element
  - Update the text above each `<progress>` element
  - If the Freaky Fungus runs out of HP, the monster is dead and you win! Replace the `walk` class with a `dead` class on the freaky-fungus element, to make them fall over and die.
  - If you run out of AP, the monster wins and humanity is doomed ðŸ˜¢ Replace the `walk` class with a `jump` class on the freaky-fungus element, to make them jump for the glory of the fungal race.
    - You may no longer attack, if AP is `0`. Give all of the attack buttons a [`disabled`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_disabled.asp) attribute, so they may no longer be used.
